                ingredients, reducing the need for costly supplements while increasing the nutritional value of
                our meals.</p>

            <p>At Culinary Services Group we deliver a better dining experience. Our recipe for success starts with
                fresh, high-quality ingredients that are locally-sourced as often as possible. Then, we add plenty of
                resident feedback. We survey residents to learn more about their needs and preferences. We believe that
                a good dining program listens to its customers and that good nutrition needs to be enjoyable too.
                Finally, we stir in restaurant-quality menus tailored to meet your community’s needs.</p>
